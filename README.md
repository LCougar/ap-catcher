Wordlist generator based on person information (keywords);
Uses permutation and element exclusion to generate a wordlist based on keywords.

The great difference in this case is the element exclusion. When whe brute force with a generated wordlist we don't know if all the words specified are necessarily being used. Said that, its possible to increase success rate over 170 percent.

Can be used in early brute force attacks due to the large number of passwords that are related to the target profile, which mostly are visible information.

# Future updates:

- Multithreading;
- Custom character limit;
- Combine wordlists;
- Automatic uppercase;
- Port to others OS's and programming languages;
